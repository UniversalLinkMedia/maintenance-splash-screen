# Maintenance Splash Screen

Users are constantly greeted by CSS lacking error pages that look unproffesional and... well just plain ugly.

Here's a splash page that took all of 10 minutes to create.

# It's not just for maintenance...

Changing the text to a status code '404'or '301' makes this splash page multi-useful for your projects.

You'll never have to think about error pages ever again...

# Responsive

The code is responsive, containers relative to the browser width for cross platform support.

# Colours

The colour scheme has been carefully selected to give a nod to retro Apple products and modern
CSS frameworks such as 'Materialize CSS'.



No attribution required, really... it took 10 minutes and it's 77 lines.
Dont' worry about it ;)
